Tk::LogScale Module

Tk::LogScale is a Tk::Scale widget with logarithmic scale.

For example, if you want to let the user input map scales from 1:1000
to 1:100000, you can use this piece of code:

    $logscale = $top->LogScale(-from       => 1000,
                               -to         => 100000,
                               -resolution => 0.01,
                               -valuefmt   => sub { sprintf("1:%d", $_[0]) },
                              );

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make install

Windows users should replace make by nmake (ActivePerl) or dmake
(Vanilla/Strawberry Perl).

For a demonstration, use

	$ make demo

As an additional requirement (it's only really necessary if the
-variable option is used), the Tie::Watch module should be installed
(which is by default since Tk 800.022).
